It can be tricky to display code in a way that doesn't clash with the existing design.

Thankfully, there are highlighters like [Prism](https://prismjs.com/). In fact, [Missing Style](https://missing.style/) comes with a readymade stylesheet just for it.

<figure>
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/missing.css@1.1.2/prism">
```
</figure>

Although Astro uses another highlighter, Shiki, out of the box, we can set it up so that Markdown files' code blocks use the **\<Prism /\>** component.

<figure>
```js
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [...],
  markdown: {
    syntaxHighlight: 'prism',
  }
});
```
</figure>

Now, we just have a small issue...

```rust
println!("Code figures aren't consistent!");
```

The next trick was to use **.mdx** which let me inline the necessary **\<figure\>** element into my document.

<figure>
```python
print("Now, isn't that better?");
```
</figure>
