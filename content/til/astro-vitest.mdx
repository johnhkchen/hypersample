**If you know HTML, you already know enough to write your first Astro component.**

Astro component syntax is a superset of HTML. The syntax was [designed to feel familiar to anyone with experience writing HTML or JSX](#differences-between-astro-and-jsx), and adds support for including components and JavaScript expressions.

## JSX-like Expressions

You can define local JavaScript variables inside of the frontmatter component script between the two code fences (`---`) of an Astro component. You can then inject these variables into the component's HTML template using JSX-like expressions!

:::note[dynamic vs reactive]
Using this approach, you can include **dynamic** values that are calculated in the frontmatter. But once included, these values are not **reactive** and will never change. Astro components are templates that only run once, during the rendering step.

See below for more examples of [differences between Astro and JSX](#differences-between-astro-and-jsx).
